<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<br>
<br>
</h4>Hello! I am a designer with an interest in sustainability through the lens of ecology and decreased dependencies
 to create closed and self sustaining systems. Socially I am concerned with food sovereignty and the potential for 
 permaculture practices in closed loop systems which plays hand in hand with ecological sustainability. I also have a strong 
 passion for computer graphics and technology to develop more efficient workflows in the architectural pipeline especially between BIM and visualization.
