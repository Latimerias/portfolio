<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<br>
<br>
</h4>Hello, I am a current architecture student with an interest in sustainability through the lense of ecology and decreased dependencies
 to create closed and self sustaining systems. Socially I am concerned with food justice and the potential for 
 permaculture practices in closed loop systems which plays hand in hand with ecological sustainability. During my time in school I have built
 a passion for computer graphics and technology to develop more efficient workflows in the architectural pipeline especially between BIM and visualization.
