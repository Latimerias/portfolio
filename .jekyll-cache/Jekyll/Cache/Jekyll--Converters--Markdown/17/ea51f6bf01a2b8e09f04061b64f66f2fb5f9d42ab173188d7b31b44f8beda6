I"∫<p>Sometimes images or any type of file sequence gets rendered out with the wrong naming convention and if you have hundreds of files manual renaming is out of the question. Heres how you can automatically rename file sequences on windows through the powershell.</p>

<p>Step 1: set the proper drive that files you want to rename are on by typing ‚Äòdrive:‚Äô which would look something like ‚Äòd:‚Äô, it is not case sensitive.</p>

<p>Step 2: set the location of the files to be renamed by typing: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set-location -Path "location"</code> which would look something like this set-location -Path ‚ÄúD:\stuff\stuff\stuff\stuff‚Äù.</p>

<p>Step 3: is to rename all files using the command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dir | %{Rename-item $_ -NewName ("name_{0}.ext" -f $nr++)}</code>
The only words you change are in quotes, with ‚Äúname‚Äù being the name you want for each file and .ext being the file extension. So it could look something like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dir |%{Rename-item $_ -NewName ("frame_{0}.jpg" -f $nr++)}</code>. Note that you need to remove the single quotes around the commands.</p>
