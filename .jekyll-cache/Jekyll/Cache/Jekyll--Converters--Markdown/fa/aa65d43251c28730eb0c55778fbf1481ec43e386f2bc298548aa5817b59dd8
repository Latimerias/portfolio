  <li>
    <p>Footpaths act as swales and are level along contour so that water can be caught and absorbed, slowing down infiltration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planting soil needs low compaction so it is aerated meaning it cannot be walked on or laid on so beds should be double reach with paths/swales on each side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the beds situated below the swales they absorb nutrient steams if the water picks up fertilizer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water catchment tanks collect water from roofs and hold it for distribution during drought and overflow can be directed into the gardens swales or ponds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spiders, frogs, lizards, chickens, ducks, rabbits help remove pests and weeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ponds can also be useful in providing for wetland plants, frogs, algae, fertilizer and used in aquaponics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mixing perennials and annuals increases diversity and allows for natural mulch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sacrificial species can be grown early on and used to replenish the soil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fast growing ground covers are needed to use as compost/fertilizer base (Alfalfa, Gotu Kola, Herb Robert).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compost worms only feed on organic matter meaning they will not go into soil so you can create pits of organic matter inside of a perforated tube and dig it into the center of a planter bed where the worms will excrete a nutrients for the surrounding plants and water will carry it between down contour as it travels through swales/beds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Near concrete or other built infrastructure and thermal mass like concrete or stone the soil will be dryer and closer to an arid environment so plants nearby should require less water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use vertical space by looking for plants that have long trunks and produce high up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compact soil results in decompacting plants like dandelions which have deep roots that will create compost corridors that decompact the soil when they die or are cut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the soil is too loose plants will grow with net like roots that hold the soil together and stop erosion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post fire soil is often low in potassium meaning plants need to be able to efficiently harvest potassium, and example is the bracken fern. You can cut the ferns into mulch to return potassium to the soil.</p>
