## Animation

The docs define a value clip as "An individual layer containing time varying data over some interval.", this seems to mean that a value clip is simple a layer with time samples.

A clip set is a group of value clips that can be partitioned like in a video editor. So you could have 2 value clips; a run cycle and a walk cycle. In the clip set you can start the have the animation start with the run cycle, stop halfway through, switch to the walk cycle, then back to the remaining half of the run cycle. You could then have another clipset that does the opposite.

Each Clip Set has a Clip Manifest layer/file that declares all of the time sampled attributes, not their values for the clips in the clip set. This saves the value resolution algorithm from having to look through every value clip in the clip set to find out which values to take into account. 

USD Stitch Clips will generate a Clip Set, where each frame/USD file represents a value clip. This means that the generated file will have a manifest since there is the possibility that the time sampled attributes may change by frame.

The value clip LOP will create a value clip. It takes in a Manifest which can be generated by the usdstitchclips ROP and the clips to use.
