I was very fortunate to be able to an ecological ADU designed and built by placecraft.
https://www.placecraftnw.com/natureorienteddwelling/adunod

Some noticeable features of this project are
- Earthen floor
  - This is a non-structural floor that sits inside the stem wall and above the floor insulation and control layers. It has a very nice feel to walk on and is easily repairable by a single person.

- Straw insulation. Walls are insulation with StraBloc which gives an R-value of 1.9 per inch

- FasWall IFC stem wall
  - This is the structural support of the ADU and goes below the frost line to stop movement from earth expansion/contraction. This product has also been used by EcoNest and is popular amongst natural builders needing to navigate building code.

- Openings are taped and seams of control layers as well.

- Smart vapor barrier is used
