## PNW Worm Bin

The base bin is made from wood that has been recycled from the project Mine Seed. It measure 40"x20"x8". It would have been beneficial to make the bin 12" tall and out of a unprocessed lumber but since the material was recycled this is the result.

## Management & Planning

The bin is currently going to be filled with dried leaves and flowers, egg cartons and cardboard which will be topped with a little bit of soil, watered and then dry leaves placed on top. 

The bin is started in July and temperatures are not expected to be a problem. Winter management strategies will be to potentially add insulation, create a cold frame and lower the C:N ratio to increase thermophilic microbes like standard compost. 

## The First Days

Rocks and drainage holes make up the bottom layer of the bin that allow for excess moisture to be released.

The bedding is composed of cardboard, newspaper, leaves and other plant debris, hair and a small amount of leafy green food scraps. This is moistened with tap water which contains chloramine that cannot be off-gassed like chlorine and I will have to see if this impacts the productivity of the bin. It would be ideal to collect rainwater but this bin is being started in the summer.

## Second Week

Using water with chloramine has not caused noticeable harm to the bins productivity. I have upped the food scraps being added to about 1.5x the weight of the worms as they have been eating very fast, especially things like cucumber opposed to something like avocado which took a bit longer.
