    <p>      
      Having only lived in America I would say that the culture here is not very food dependant. What I mean by this is that the relationship Americans have with food 
      is a negative one. Take for example grocery shopping, it is seen as a chore where you go to a massive warehouse store with a prepared list of items to purchase and you
      spend an hour or two mazing around the store trying to find what you need until you become familiar with the layout. Also important but a slight tangent is that these 
      warehouse stores are built on a global infrastructure that has exponential repercussions and dangers and is the exact opposite of what I advocate for which is local 
      closed systems. This example of grocery shopping contrasts other cultures which I would call more food based meaning their lives revolves more around food where they 
      would go shopping at the local market and interact with vendors and shoppers, becoming more involved in the food infrastructure. For this system to work of course
      you need more local economy because individuals needs to be able to be able to create their own farms or businesses. The previous problem regards more of the public 
      realm while Americans also have a very poor personal relationship with food which begins to overlap food culture and food justice. This problem is seen in the rush that
      Americans are often in when eating resulting in them consuming fast food, I myself tend to never spend more than 15 minutes eating which is a result of the current culture
      which is profession based and individualistic. What I am trying to say is that food brings people together, food based culture creates more interactive society, food based
      culture reduces food injustice, food based culture makes people happier. Unfortunately this is greater than architecture and relies heavily on policy but architecture can 
      still play a significant role.

    <p>      
      I realize food justice is not a frequently talked about subject so here I will define what it means to me and it architectural implication.

    <p>      
      Emerging technology and specialization in lighting design, specifically in schools are focused on enforcing the existing American education system which we know
      is failing. These lighting systems and designers and often the teachers at these schools follow the ideology that purely diffuse light provides the best learning 
      environment for children. This creates space that is very static for the users and you can imagine the type of learning this enforces which is a group of students sitting
      down for hours a day and then complaining about how much they hate school for years on end. Whats truly strange is how we expect them to enjoy these places. Such practices
      are based upon control, repetition and efficiency in a way where the school is looked at as a machine which is an idea we have moved past in many other typologies. My real
      gripe with these spaces is that they do not provide opportunity for exploration, there is no spontaneity or stimulation. Every day is repeated over and over again. It is
      obvious that kids, people, living things are not meant to be sedentary physically or mentally yet the space everywhere around us does not help us with that.

    <p>      
      As I find out more about ecological living infrastrcutre and self sufficient systems the more I realize that basically all of this has been done before, for decades all around
      the world. The one thing that strikes me when seeing these allready existing systems is the architecture which is often old and traditional in design. However these places are thriving
      and vibrant where just the sight of them creates a jealousy of community and living conditions. This reminds me of the saying "it is not the clothes that makes the person but the person 
      that makes the clothes" where in this case the people living in the place make it vibrant. It is not as though these people are any more special than those outside but that the self
      sufficient lifesytle and act of gardening and working outside creates a vibrance. This comes to my mind as I begin to question what is architecture when I see makeshift structure but also 
      the occupants living fufilling lives. This has lead me to question less what architecture is and more of what architecture can be, how can architecture create even better conditions and start
      to help support the self sustaining systems. Thermal mass can be used selectively to create more dry microclimates allowing for specific plant species to be grown. The permaculture systems
      extending inside of the built environment.
