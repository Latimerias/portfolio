    Food Based Culture - Opinion Piece
    <br>Having only lived in America I would say that the culture here is not very food dependant. What I mean by this is that the relationship Americans have with food 
    is a negative one. Take for example grocery shopping, it is seen as a chore where you go to a massive warehouse store with a prepared list of items to purchase and you
    spend an hour or two mazing around the store trying to find what you need until you become familiar with the layout. Also important but a slight tangent is that these 
    warehouse stores are built on a global infrastructure that has exponential repercussions and dangers and is the exact opposite of what I advocate for which is local 
    closed systems. This example of grocery shopping contrasts other cultures which I would call more food based meaning their lives revolves more around food where they 
    would go shopping at the local market and interact with vendors and shoppers, becoming more involved in the food infrastructure. For this system to work of course
    you need more local economy because individuals needs to be able to be able to create their own farms or businesses. The previous problem regards more of the public 
    realm while Americans also have a very poor personal relationship with food which begins to overlap food culture and food justice. This problem is seen in the rush that
    Americans are often in when eating resulting in them consuming fast food, I myself tend to never spend more than 15 minutes eating which is a result of the current culture
    which is profession based and individualistic. What I am trying to say is that food brings people together, food based culture creates more interactive society, food based
    culture reduces food injustice, food based culture makes people happier. Unfortunately this is greater than architecture and relies heavily on policy but architecture can 
    still play a significant role.
